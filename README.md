# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-with-Tableau
This project is an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Tableau, designed to analyze employee data and provide actionable insights for decision-makers. The dashboard focuses on key metrics like employee attrition, age distribution, department-specific trends, and job satisfaction. The project has been optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

# Features
**Interactive Visualizations**:
Attrition rates segmented by gender, age groups, and departments.
Job satisfaction ratings for different roles.
Employee count distributions by age and job category.

**Calculated Fields:**
Attrition rates and active employee counts calculated directly in Tableau.

**Responsive Design:**
Dashboard optimized for desktop, mobile, and tablet users.

**Custom Color Palette:**
Color schemes derived using Adobe Color for a visually appealing and accessible interface. (See attached palette files.)

# Insights and Recommendations
**Insights:**

**Attrition Analysis:**
The Research & Development (R&D) department has the highest attrition rate, contributing significantly to overall attrition.
Employees aged 25-34 exhibit the highest attrition levels, making up nearly 29% of all attrition cases.
Gender-based Trends:

Attrition is higher among female employees, accounting for 56.12% of all cases, compared to 38.82% for males.
Travel and Job Satisfaction:

Employees required to travel frequently experience higher attrition compared to those who travel rarely or not at all.
Job satisfaction ratings show that employees in roles like Research Scientist and Sales Representative report higher satisfaction than those in managerial positions.

**Recommendations:**

**Targeted Retention Strategies:**
Implement focused retention programs for employees aged 25-34, especially in the R&D department.
Offer flexible work arrangements or mentorship programs for female employees to improve retention.

**Travel Policy Adjustments:**
Reassess travel requirements for roles with higher attrition to reduce employee burnout.
Explore hybrid or remote options for employees who travel frequently.

**Job Role Development:**
Conduct role-specific satisfaction surveys and create focus group discussions to identify improvement areas for job roles with lower satisfaction ratings.
Offer professional development opportunities to enhance satisfaction and retention for managerial roles.
